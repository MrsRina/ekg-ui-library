The docking system of the layout service runs for all containers, which means, the processing only works for the container category. The processing is invoked when necessary, every change on stacked widgets, like size, and position, dispatch the layout task.

A widget can be aligned by following docks:  
`fill` `next` `none` `right` `top` `bottom`  
By default, the docking is automatically `left-aligned` and `top-aligned.
